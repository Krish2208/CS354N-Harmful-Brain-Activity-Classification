## Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook to run `.ipynb` files.
3. Clone the repository or download the notebook files.

### Steps:
1. **Download Required Packages:**
   - Ensure you have the following packages installed: `os`, `gc`, `sys`, `math`, `time`, `random`, `datetime`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `wandb`, `glob`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `tqdm`, `torch`, `sklearn`.
   - You can install them using pip:
     ```
     pip install os gc sys math time random datetime numpy pandas wandb glob pathlib typing scipy matplotlib tqdm torch sklearn
     ```

2. **Download Data (Optional):**
   - If you prefer to download the data locally, download it from the following links:
     - [HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/data)
     - [Kaggle-KL-Div](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdeotte/kaggle-kl-div)
   - If trained models are required, you can download them from the following links:
     - [efficientnet-b1-ownspectrograms](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naomideenen/efficientnet-b1-ownspectrograms)
     - [EfficientNetB Keras TF 2.13.0](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nartaa/efficientnetb-tf-keras)
     - [Features+Head Starter Models](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nartaa/features-head-starter-models/versions/10)
     - [hms-resnet1d-gru-weights-v82](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konstantinboyko/hms-resnet1d-gru-weights-v82)
   

3. **Access Notebooks:**
   - You have two options:
     - Use the provided Kaggle Notebook links:
       - Inference Notebook: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/pvsekhar123/ensemble-model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pvsekhar123/ensemble-model)
     - Alternatively, if you've downloaded the notebooks, proceed to the next step.

4. **Open and Run Notebooks:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook interface.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the downloaded/cloned notebook files.
   - Open each notebook (`*.ipynb`) by clicking on them.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook cells.
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially.

5. **Execute Training and Inference:**
   - Follow the instructions provided within the notebooks for training and inference processes.
   - Ensure you have the necessary data available (either preloaded on Kaggle or downloaded locally).

6. **Monitor Output:**
   - Monitor the output of each cell in the notebook for any errors or progress updates.
   - Adjust parameters as necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the provided IPython Notebook files successfully.
