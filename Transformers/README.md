## Instructions:

1. **Access Notebooks:**
   - Please log in to your Kaggle account. Use the following link to access the Kaggle notebook with pre-loaded dataset and code: <br>
     [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gothos01/hms-hbac-project-transformers). <br>
      Alternatively, the .ipynb file is provided (hms-hbac-project-transformers). Please upload on kaggle, and use the following inputs on Kaggle:
     + [HMS HBAC Competition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification)
     + [Brain EEG Spectrograms Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdeotte/brain-eeg-spectrograms)
     + [Brain-Spectrograms Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdeotte/brain-spectrograms)
     <br>
     Then run all the cells sequentially.
     
2. **Training:**
   - The notebook has already been configured to be easy-to-use. Run all cells sequentially to train the model.
   Parameters can be changed by changing the config provided in the second cell.

3. **Monitor Output:**
   - Monitor the output of each cell in the notebook for any errors or progress updates.
   - Adjust parameters as necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the provided IPython Notebook files successfully.
